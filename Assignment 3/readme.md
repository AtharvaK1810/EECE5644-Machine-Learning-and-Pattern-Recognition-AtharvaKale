## 📘 Overview
This repository contains the code, figures, and report for **Assignment 3** of *EECE 5644 – Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition* at Northeastern University.  
The assignment includes two main experiments:

1. **Question 1 – MLP Classifier:**  
   Training a 4-class neural network on 3D Gaussian data and comparing test error against the Bayes-optimal classifier.

2. **Question 2 – GMM Model Order Selection:**  
   Using 10-fold cross-validation to determine the correct number of Gaussian mixture components for overlapping clusters.

Work was completed in **Python 3.10 (Google Colab)** and **MATLAB R2025b**, following TA feedback regarding activation type, dimensionality, and cross-validation folds.
