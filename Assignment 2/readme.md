#Overview

This repository contains all MATLAB code, figures, and reports for Assignment 2 of EECE5644 â€“ Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition.
The assignment explores Bayesian estimation, regression, and generative modeling using Gaussian and Dirichlet frameworks.
All experiments were executed in MATLAB R2025b.

#How to Run
1.	Open MATLAB R2025b.
2.	Navigate to the MATLAB folder:

    cd 'Assignment2/MATLAB'
    run_all_A2

3.	All figures will appear in ../figs_A2/ and results in ../results/.

#Topics Covered
1.	Two-Class Gaussian Mixtures: MAP and Logistic (Linear/Quadratic).
2.	Cubic Regression: ML vs MAP with Gaussian prior.
3.	Bayesian Localization: Sensor fusion and posterior uncertainty.
4.	Bayes Decision Boundary: Quadratic frontier for unequal covariances.
5.	Categoricalâ€“Dirichlet Model: ML and MAP estimation for discrete probabilities.
