## üß† Assignment 1 ‚Äì Gaussian Generative Models

**Topics Covered:**
- Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) for binary Gaussian classification  
- Naive Bayes approximation with diagonal covariance  
- Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)  
- 4-class Gaussian mixture classification (MAP and ERM rules)  
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) on real-world datasets  
  - Wine Quality dataset (UCI)  
  - Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset (UCI)  
- Regularization, PCA visualization, and confidence interval analysis  

**Highlights:**
- Achieved 97% accuracy for 4-class Gaussian MAP classification  
- 99.7% accuracy on HAR dataset using regularized QDA  
- Full ROC analysis and risk minimization with cost-sensitive losses  
- All figures include digital signatures for author attribution

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Reproduce Results

1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the Assignment 1 directory:
   cd 'Assignment1_GaussianModels/Matlab'
   run_all
2. Output figures will be saved under `../Figures/`  
3. CSV results (confusion matrices, accuracies, risks) will be saved under `../Results/`  
4. Ensure dataset paths are correctly defined in `run_all.m`:
   - Wine Dataset ‚Üí `winequality-white.csv`
   - HAR Dataset ‚Üí `UCI HAR Dataset`
