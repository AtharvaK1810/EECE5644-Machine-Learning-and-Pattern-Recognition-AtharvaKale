## 📘 Overview
This assignment explores Bayesian decision theory and Gaussian generative classifiers through simulation, analytical derivations, and real-world data.  
The work demonstrates the performance trade-offs among **ERM**, **Naive Bayes**, **LDA**, and **QDA**, as well as their extensions to multiclass and cost-sensitive problems.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Open MATLAB (R2025b or later).  
2. Navigate to the **Matlab** folder:
   ```matlab
   cd 'Assignment1_GaussianModels/Matlab'
   run_all

3.	Figures are saved in ../Figures/ and results in ../Results/.
4.	Datasets for Q3 (Wine Quality, HAR) must be placed in the same directory or have their paths set in the script.
